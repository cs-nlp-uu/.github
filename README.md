# Natural Language Processing

**Natural Language Processing** is one of the research groups of the division **AI & Data Science** within the department of **[Information and Computing sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences)**.

## Brief History of the NLP group:

The NLP group was founded in 2018, when Prof. Kees van Deemter and Dr. Dong Nguyen joined the UU. Over the years, various people joined the NLP group, broadening its range and reinforcing our focus on mainly theoretical aspects of NLP, covering both symbolic and statistical approaches. An important recent focus is explainability.

Our currents research strengths include a theme called NLP and Society, a theme called Natural Language Generation. In all these areas we work closely with the NLP group at [OTS/UiL](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences), for example through joint supervision of PhD students. We contribute to various areas of teaching in the department, for example via the UUâ€™s cross-faculty Bachelor and Master degrees in Artficial Intelligence.

The group is currently managed by [professor Albert Gatt](https://www.uu.nl/staff/AGatt).
